# Internal Docs

This section is for operational runbooks, troubleshooting notes, and roadmap material that is useful to maintainers but not part of the public user journey.

## What lives here

- CI/release operations and secret management runbooks
- Agent and hook troubleshooting procedures
- Future-looking roadmap notes and experiments

If a page becomes stable user-facing guidance, move it into the top-level docs nav.
