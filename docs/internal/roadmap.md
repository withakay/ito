# Roadmap Notes (Internal)

This page tracks potential directions for Ito that are not committed roadmap items.

## Status labels

- `exploring`: collecting requirements and trade-offs
- `candidate`: plausible near-term work

### Agent workflow ergonomics (`candidate`)

- Reduce instruction verbosity while preserving deterministic behavior.
- Improve task state sync and audit diagnostics.

### Multi-change coordination (`exploring`)

- Guardrails for parallel implementation sequencing.

### IDE/editor integration (`parking-lot`)

- Richer navigation from tasks/specs into code.
- Optional extension support for common editors.
