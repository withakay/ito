# Ito Documentation

Welcome to the Ito docs site.

## Ito

- Thread/String (糸): Used for sewing thread, yarn, or in a metaphorical sense for connections.
- Intention/Aim (意図): Often used in the context of plans, aims, or intent.



This site combines:

- curated project guides from `docs/`
- generated API reference from `cargo doc`, published under `docs/rustdoc/`
