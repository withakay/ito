# Test Support

## Purpose
Test utilities and helpers for Ito (`ito-test-support` crate). Shared test fixtures, builders, fakes, and assertion helpers used across crate test suites.

## Scope
- Unit test helpers, mock repository implementations, and in-memory fakes for `ito-domain` traits used across crate test suites. Does not cover integration test frameworks or production runtime utilities.
