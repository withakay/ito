# Add Init Command for Ito

## Why

Projects need a simple way to adopt Ito conventions. Currently, users must manually create the directory structure and understand all the conventions, which creates friction for adoption. An init command would enable instant Ito setup with proper structure and guidance.

## What Changes

- Add `ito init` CLI command that creates the complete Ito directory structure
- Generate template files (README.md with AI instructions, project.md template)
- Interactive prompt to select which AI tools to configure (Claude Code initially, others marked as "coming soon")
- Support for multiple AI coding assistants with extensible plugin architecture
- Smart file updates using content markers to preserve existing configurations
- Custom directory naming with `--dir` flag
- Validation to prevent overwriting existing Ito structures
- Clear error messages with helpful guidance (e.g., suggesting 'ito update' for existing structures)
- Display actionable next steps after successful initialization

### Breaking Changes
