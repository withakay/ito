Commands:
  init    Legacy no-op
  list    Legacy no-op
  show    Legacy no-op
  run     Legacy no-op
  status  Legacy no-op

Options:
      --no-color
          Disable color output

      --help-all
          Print the full CLI reference (equivalent to `ito help --all`)

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
